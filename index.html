        <p>This recipe features boiled spaghetti noodles, delicious marinara sauce
            and a topping of parmesean cheese and italian meatballs. It's quick, easy, and delicious!
            Make sure to focus on cooking the meatballs to perfection and sprinkling a modest amount
            of parmesean cheese when serving.
